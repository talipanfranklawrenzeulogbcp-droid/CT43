# Great Solomon Manpower Services Inc. Core Transaction 4 — PHP/MySQL Backend

This package is a database-backed PHP application for Core Transaction 4.

## Structure
- `auth/` — login and logout
- `modules/health_safety/` — Health, Safety & Welfare
- `modules/legal_compliance/` — Legal & Compliance
- `modules/system_admin_security/` — System Administration & Security
- `dashboard.php` — Reports, Analysis & Dashboard (central tracking for the four modules)
- `modules/asset_equipment/` — Asset & Equipment Issuance
- `includes/` — database, authentication and helper code
- `database/database.sql` — MySQL database and tables
- `app.js` — JavaScript
- `style.css` — CSS


## Install
1. Put the project in Apache/XAMPP `htdocs`.
2. Import `database/database.sql` into MySQL/phpMyAdmin.
3. If needed, edit `includes/config.php` or set `GSMS_DB_HOST`, `GSMS_DB_NAME`, `GSMS_DB_USER`, and `GSMS_DB_PASS`.
4. Open the project in a browser.

## Default login
- Name: `Admin`
- Email: `adminct4@gmail.com`
- Password: `ISMERSCT4`

## Login flow
The login uses the account password followed by a 6-digit Gmail OTP before the dashboard opens.

Passwords are stored using PHP `password_hash()` and verified with `password_verify()`.

## Notes
The application uses the shared authentication and helper files across all modules. Logging out destroys the current session.


## Two-Step Login (Gmail OTP)

The login now uses password + a 6-digit OTP before opening the dashboard.

- Sender: `governancesafety21@gmail.com`
- SMTP: Gmail on port 587 with STARTTLS
- OTP validity: 10 minutes
- Maximum OTP attempts: 5
- Resend OTP is available on the verification screen.
- Administrator seed account: `adminct4@gmail.com`
- Administrator name: `Admin`
- Administrator password: `ISMERSCT4`

For production, move the Gmail App Password from `includes/config.php` to environment variables:
`GSMS_MAIL_USERNAME` and `GSMS_MAIL_PASSWORD`.

## Microservices update

This version separates the four Core Transaction 4 modules into service boundaries under `services/`. See `MICROSERVICES.md` for the service map, API gateway, connection flow, and deployment notes.




## CT4 UI updates
- Health, Safety & Welfare now supports date filtering with calendar controls for Health Records and Safety Incident Reports.
- Login History displays only date/time, email, user, and role.
- User Accounts includes a centered Edit User modal for name, email, and optional password changes.
- Asset Issuance History includes Returned / Not Returned actions and a detectable status badge.
- The top-right user name opens Feedback, Terms and Conditions, and Logout. Feedback is emailed to the first active Administrator account.


## Gemini AI System Assistant
The sidebar now includes **AI System Assistant**. It uses a server-side Gemini API call and supplies Gemini with authorized CT4 context such as module descriptions, documentation, live record counts, recent audit metadata, login totals, and the current signed-in user's name/role.

For security, passwords/password hashes, OTPs, SMTP credentials, API keys, session tokens and database credentials are not sent to Gemini. The browser never receives the Gemini API key.

### Server environment
Set these variables on the PHP server (not in JavaScript or a public file):
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — your Gemini API key
- `GEMINI_MODEL` — defaults to `gemini-3.8-flash`

See `.env.example` for the names only. For the supplied local build, the Gemini key is stored in the server-only `.env` file and is never sent to browser JavaScript. Rotate the supplied key after testing because it was shared during setup.


## CT4 Authentication and Gmail OTP
The supplied build is configured to use `governancesafety21@gmail.com` as the Gmail SMTP sender for login OTP messages. The sender uses a Gmail App Password (not the normal Gmail password). For production deployment, set `GSMS_MAIL_USERNAME`, `GSMS_MAIL_PASSWORD`, `GSMS_MAIL_FROM_EMAIL`, and `GSMS_OTP_SENDER_EMAIL` as server environment variables instead of relying on the bundled fallback.

The database seed provisions the main administrator as:
- Email: `adminct4@gmail.com`
- Role: `Administrator`

Import `database/database.sql` into MySQL before first use. PHP must have OpenSSL and cURL enabled. If SMTP is blocked by the hosting provider, allow outbound SMTP/TLS traffic on port 587.

## Role-based access
Staff accounts can access Reports, Analysis & Dashboard, AI System Assistant, Health, Safety & Welfare, Legal & Compliance, and Asset & Equipment Issuance. System Administration & Security is administrator-only. Administrator dashboards include staff activity tracking for the Health, Safety & Welfare, Legal & Compliance, and Asset & Equipment Issuance modules through audit records.

## Deployment configuration

For Docker/HostForge deployment, use port `80` and health-check path `/health.php`. The Docker build compiles PHP extensions in parallel and excludes local archives, logs, caches, secrets, and development artifacts from the image build context to reduce build time.
Set the server environment variables from `.env.example`. The application reads `DATABASE_URL` first when supplied, otherwise the `DB_*` variables (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`/`DB_NAME`, `DB_USERNAME`/`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`). Gmail OTP uses `GSMS_MAIL_*` and `GSMS_OTP_SENDER_EMAIL`; Gemini uses `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL`.
Do not upload a real `.env` containing secrets into the deployment image.
